Absolutely ‚Äî here's **Day 1: Comprehensions**, now rewritten in the same format as Day 2. This version is clean, focused, and consistent with your preferred working style.

## ‚úÖ **Day 1: Comprehensions (List, Dict, Set)**

### üîç What You‚Äôll Learn

* Write more expressive, compact code using comprehensions
* Replace verbose loops with idiomatic one-liners
* Work with filters (`if` clauses) inside comprehensions
* Translate between loops and comprehension syntax
* Practice comprehension types: `list`, `dict`, and `set`

---

### üß† Key Concepts

| Comprehension Type | Syntax Example                                  |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------- |
| List               | `[x for x in data if x > 0]`                    |
| Dict               | `{k: v for k, v in pairs if k.startswith('x')}` |
| Set                | `{x for x in data if x % 2 == 0}`               |

### üîß Practice Tasks

#### \[ ] **Rewrite a basic `for` loop as a list comprehension**

```python
# Before:
result = []
for x in range(10):
    if x % 2 == 0:
        result.append(x * 2)

# After:
result = [x * 2 for x in range(10) if x % 2 == 0]
```

#### \[ ] **Write a dict comprehension from a list of tuples**

```python
pairs = [('host', 'localhost'), ('port', 8080), ('debug', True)]
config = {key: value for key, value in pairs}
```

#### \[ ] **Write a set comprehension that deduplicates and filters**

```python
names = ['Alice', 'Bob', 'alice', 'BOB']
unique_lower = {name.lower() for name in names}
```

#### \[ ] **Create a nested comprehension**

```python
matrix = [[1, 2], [3, 4]]
flattened = [x for row in matrix for x in row]
```

### üß™ Real-World Task (Optional)

* Pick a function in your **bundle builder**
* Identify a loop that builds a list, dict, or set
* Rewrite it as a comprehension
* Compare readability and performance if possible

---

### üìù Notes Section

```text
- Did any comprehension feel less intuitive than others?
- Were there any examples where the loop was actually clearer than the comprehension?
- Are there any places in your code where comprehension improved both brevity and clarity?
```
